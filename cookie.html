                <p>Welcome to <span class="accent-keyword">Rocket Play</span> Casino ("the Platform," "we," "us," "our"). This Cookie Policy is designed to inform you about our practices regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website. This policy explains what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights to control their use.</p>

                <h2 class="h3 mt-5">2. What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and remember your preferences.</p>
                <p>Cookies can be categorized as:</p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These are temporary and are deleted from your device when you close your browser.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> These remain on your device for a specified period or until you manually delete them.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>First-party Cookies:</strong> These are set by the website you are visiting (us).</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Third-party Cookies:</strong> These are set by a domain other than the one you are visiting, such as our analytics or advertising partners.</li>

                <h3 class="h4 mt-4">3.3. Functionality Cookies:</h3>
                <p>These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language, or region) to provide a more personalized experience. They can save you from having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit, making your experience smoother after you use the <span class="accent-keyword">rocket play login</span> .</p>
                <h3 class="h4 mt-4">3.4. Marketing and Targeting Cookies:</h3>
