                    <h2 class="mt-5">1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                    <p><strong>1.1.</strong> These Terms and Conditions ("Terms," "Agreement") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("the Player," "you") and the operator of Rocket Play Casino ("the Company," "we," "us").</p>
                    <p><strong>1.2.</strong> This Agreement governs your use of all our online gaming services, including our website, mobile applications, and any related products (collectively, the "Services").</p>
                    <p><strong>1.3.</strong> By creating an account, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted these Terms, along with our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Responsible Gambling Policy, which are integral parts of this Agreement.</p>
                    <p><strong>1.4.</strong> If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not create an account and must cease using the Services immediately.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5">2. Your Player Account</h2>
                    <p><strong>2.1. Registration and Eligibility:</strong> To use our Services, you must register for a personal account ("Account"). To be eligible, you must be at least 18 years of age or the legal age for gambling in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher. You must provide accurate and complete information during registration and keep this information up to date.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.2. Account Security:</strong> You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your <span class="accent-keyword">rocket play login</span> credentials (username and password). You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs on your Account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. We are not liable for any loss you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.3. Account Access:</strong> All activities conducted on the Platform after a successful <span class="accent-keyword">rocket play casino login</span> are deemed to have been performed by you. It is your responsibility to secure the device you use to access the Services. Your credentials grant you access to all services, from managing your account to initiating a <span class="accent-keyword">rocket play slot login</span> to play your favorite games.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.4. Account Verification (KYC):</strong> We are required by law to verify the identity, age, and address of our players. We reserve the right to request verification documents at any stage. Failure to provide satisfactory documentation may result in the suspension or closure of your Account.</p>
                    <p><strong>2.5. One Account Rule:</strong> You are permitted to register and operate only one Account. If we discover that you hold multiple accounts, we reserve the right to close any or all of them, voiding any wagers and winnings.</p>

                    <p><strong>3.1. Deposits:</strong> To play for real money, you must deposit funds into your Account using one of our approved payment methods. You warrant that you are the legal owner of the funds and the payment method used.</p>
                    <p><strong>3.2. Withdrawals:</strong> You may request a withdrawal from your real money balance, provided your account is fully verified and you have met any applicable bonus wagering requirements. We reserve the right to process withdrawals to the same method used for depositing, where possible. Processing times may vary depending on the method and any additional verification checks required.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5">4. Bonuses and Promotions</h2>

                    <p><strong>4.2. Wagering Requirements:</strong> Most bonuses come with wagering requirements that must be fulfilled before the bonus funds or associated winnings can be withdrawn. The specific requirements will be clearly stated in the promotional terms.</p>
                    <p><strong>4.3. Bonus Abuse:</strong> We have a strict policy against bonus abuse. This includes, but is not limited to, creating multiple accounts to claim bonuses, using low-risk betting strategies to meet wagering requirements, or any other action deemed to be in bad faith. Any player found to be abusing promotional offers may have their bonuses and winnings voided and their account closed.</p>
